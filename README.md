# Big Data in Health Care
This project aimed to develop and compare predictive models for metastasis-free survival in women with node-positive breast cancer, using both clinical variables and gene expression data. Starting from a well-curated dataset of 144 patients and 78 variables—70 of which are gene expression levels—the analysis involved univariate and multivariate Cox regression to assess the prognostic value of clinical factors such as tumor size, number of affected lymph nodes, and hormone receptor status. A penalized Cox model using the Lasso method was applied to identify a subset of gene expressions significantly associated with patient outcomes. Two models were built: a basic one using only clinical data, and an enhanced one incorporating selected gene expression variables. Despite limitations in sample size and challenges in graphical interpretation of assumptions, the results highlight the potential of integrating clinical and genomic data to improve personalized risk prediction in oncology.
